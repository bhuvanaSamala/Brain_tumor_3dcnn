# Brain_tumor_3dcnn
This project uses deep learning to detect brain tumors in MRI scans. A CNN-based model classifies images as tumor or non-tumor with high accuracy, leveraging transfer learning for optimization. It includes Grad-CAM visualization for interpretability and a Flask/FastAPI-based web app for easy MRI scan uploads and predictions. ðŸš€
